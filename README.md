## Technologies and Libraries Used

Here are the technologies and libraries we've employed in the development of this app:

- **React.js**: We've built the app using React.js, a powerful library for creating interactive user interfaces.

- **Sass**: Sass is used to preprocess CSS files, simplifying the management and styling of the application.

- **React Router DOM**: We've implemented React Router DOM to create a Single Page Application (SPA), facilitating seamless navigation between different views within the app.

## Features

Our app currently offers the following features:

- **Browse Products**: Users can effortlessly browse available products, view product details, and explore various categories.

- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart, which keeps track of selected items.
